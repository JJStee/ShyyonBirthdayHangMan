    <p>This is a simple Hangman game. The goal is to guess the word sequence by suggesting individual letters one at a time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each time you guess a correct letter, it will be revealed in the word.</li>
        <li>If you guess an incorrect letter, a part of the hangman will be drawn.</li>
        <li>You can only make seven incorrect guesses before the hangman is completed. The sequence is then displayed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These word sequences provide accurate and factual descriptions of yourself.</p>
